### Firefox

```powershell
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "installer.ps1"
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kantholy/psmgmt/refs/heads/master/apps/firefox.ps1 -OutFile $installer
. $installer
```

> [!NOTE] 
> available flags:
> `-updateonly` only updates firefox if installed already
> `-autoupdate:$false` prevents the installation of the firefox maintenance service
